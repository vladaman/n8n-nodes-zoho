## Configuration

### 1. Zoho Developer Setup
Before using the nodes, you need to create a Zoho application:

1. Go to [Zoho Developer Console](https://api-console.zoho.com/)
2. Create a new application and note your **Client ID** and **Client Secret**
3. Configure appropriate scopes based on the services you'll use:
   - **Sheets**: `ZohoSheet.operation.ALL`
   - **Tasks**: `ZohoTasks.operation.ALL`
   - **Billing**: `ZohoBilling.operation.ALL`  
   - **Email**: `ZohoMail.operation.ALL`

### 2. n8n Credential Configuration

1. In n8n, navigate to **Settings** ‚Üí **Credentials**

## Advanced Configuration

### Error Handling
All nodes include comprehensive error handling with detailed error messages. Use n8n's built-in error handling to:
- Retry failed requests
- Route errors to separate workflow paths
- Log errors for debugging

### Rate Limiting
Zoho APIs have rate limits. Consider:
- Adding delays between requests for bulk operations
- Using n8n's batch processing capabilities
- Implementing exponential backoff for retries

### Data Transformation
Leverage n8n's expression editor for:
- Dynamic parameter values
- Data format conversion
- Complex JSON manipulation

## API Documentation

Detailed API documentation is available in the `docs/` directory:
- [Email API Documentation](docs/Email.md) - Complete email functionality reference
